* Pointer effect with Hover when hovering over answers and buttons

  Buttons turn red and green when an answer is selected. After an answer is selected the correct answer will turn green and the other two wrong answers will turn     red. This feature is very helpful to the user as this will educate the user which answer was correct and which ones were wrong.

* Score panel

  As a user I think a quiz is more interesting if it has a score panel just to let you know how many answers you got correct or wrong. This features calculates the   scores when you click the correct or incorrect answer.
