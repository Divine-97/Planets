## Features
* Heading introduction to the game and Start Button
  
  Featured on the home page is the title of the quiz so the user is aware of what the quiz is about. I also have the Start button which is visible when the page is loaded, this makes it easier for the user to click on the start button inorder to start the quiz.

* Question and choice of answers on display

  I have questions that are educational and fun which will make the user want to try out all the questions. I also have 3 choices of answers on display so the user    has options.

* Pointer effect with Hover when hovering over answers and buttons

  Buttons turn red and green when an answer is selected. After an answer is selected the correct answer will turn green and the other two wrong answers will turn     red. This feature is very helpful to the user as this will educate the user which answer was correct and which ones were wrong.

* Score panel

  As a user I think a quiz is more interesting if it has a score panel just to let you know how many answers you got correct or wrong. This features calculates the   scores when you click the correct or incorrect answer.

## Features Left to Implement
 * In the future i would want the user to rate my quiz.
 * I want the users to have accounts so they can log in and be able to play against other users as well.
 * I would like to add a top score feature so users can see their scores against others.


## Testing
  To test the webpage and it's features I clicked on every button to make sure there were no issues.

  * The Heading and Start button

  The heading is visible on the home page and all pages so the user is aware of the title of the quiz. The start button is also visible on the home page and allows   the user to start the quiz when clicked on.

  This feature has no issues on all answer options. The correct answer will turn green and the other two wrong answers will turn red when an answer is selceted.     This feature is functional on every Question.

  * Score Panel

  I have made sure tbe score is calcuted when the user clicks either the correct or incorrect answer. This feature has no issues.

  * Restart and Home Button

  At the end of the game this feature will appear and will allow the user to click on either two of the buttons. I made sure that the restart button allows you do   the quiz again, or the user can click on the home page to return to the home page. I also made sure that the score/resutls of the quiz is calculated at the end     of the quiz.
